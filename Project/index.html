    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
      This project is worth 15 points of your final grade. It will be graded on the following criteria:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>5 points - Meets required criteria</li>
        <li>5 points - Style and quality of the code</li>
        <li>5 points - Write up</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Use the Goldfield library to create your own game. Any game is acceptable, but keep in mind that a simpler game will be easier to program. Even a relatively simple concept may end up being more complicated than you thought. Write a project description (see below). The following elements are required and will be weighted for half the project's points. The project must have:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Some event from player.</li>
        <li>An end goal.</li>
        <li>A reset function.</li>
        <li>Make at least one new mover.</li>
        <li>Share a library with a friend.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Write Up</h2>
    <p>
      Write a minimum of 1 full page, not much more than 2. Cover the following topics.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Instructions to use your game.</li>
        <li>What library you shared.</li>
        <li>What libraries you borrowed. Please comment in the code to show which libraries came from who?</li>
        <li>Problems you encountered and how you overcame them.</li>
        <li>Things you like or don't like about your project. What would you change or keep?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
