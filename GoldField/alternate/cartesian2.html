            Computers also track the location of a character in the vertical dimension. Because the 
            horizontal is called X, the vertical is called Y. See the Y label at the top of the screen?
            Computers orient their screen in an odd direction where the higher you go, the lower the
            numbers are. The black line shown here is just like the X dimension with postive numbers
            above a zero and negative numbers below zero.

            In a computer program, we often have a number, but we can't see anything.
            We have to use those numbers to decide what to do. It's like you are in the dark and 
            using the numbers alone to make your choices. Here we have a hero, but we also have a hidden
            gold. Can you find it?

            Do you remember the formula to find the distance to the goal? This time we are going to
            change things. We can use the distance you have and the position of the hero to fill in 
            some of the missing information. Now that we have filled in the missing information, can
            you figure out the missing location of the
