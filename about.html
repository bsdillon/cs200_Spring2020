      Brian Dillon graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in May 2007 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
      He then earned a Master of Science from Old Dominion University in Modeling in Simulation with a thesis investigating the 
      use of simulations in elementary school education, a human subjects research project in cooperation with Richmond County 
      Public Schools. He is currently enrolled as a PhD student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the 
      school of Computer Science. His advisor is Dr. Steve Edwards. His research interests include software evolution (sometimes 
      referred to as aging, degradation, entropy, decay, or rot) and software engineering best practices to mitigate and manage 
      evolutionary forces.

      Professionally, Brian works at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren Virginia where he works as a lead scientist to 
      improve software engineering practices, align government development with commercial methods, and develop software himself 
      when time allows. His work with Dahlgren has included several projects for the United States Marine Corps and collaboration 
      with numerous individuals across the Department of Defense and academia. Most notably, Brian created and led the bi-monthly 
      Software Developers’ Lecture Series from 2011 through 2017 and he collaborated with NATO representatives to bring about a 
      NATO conference on Cyber Security at Arlington, VA in 2017.

      Personally, Brian works with his wife Stacey to raise four children and stay active in their lives. They are homeschooled, 
      with Stacey providing the majority of their educational support and Brian supplementing as often as possible. Generally, 
      one or all of his family will accompany him on official travel, including side trips to local sites. Thus the picture above 
      in Washington, DC and numerous other trips to La Jolla, Fort Sumter, the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Orlando, Senoia, Austin, 
      Nashville, Kansas City, and more. Brian also has a passion for education of all kinds, especially STEM and computer science.
