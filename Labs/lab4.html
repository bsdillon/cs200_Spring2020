    <h1 class="lab">Lab 4 - Wack-a-mole</h1>
    <p>
      Create a Mole object with an x,y location and an image that is displayed
      on the screen at that location. Use a random placement to put a Mole on
      the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add a click listener to the Mole so that when the user clicks on it the
      mole "dies" and a new one is created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count the number of mole hits and add a new mole every five hits. This
      will slowly add to the number of moles on the screen. Add a reset button 
      to start over with one mole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put all this in a web page and submit it through Canvas.
