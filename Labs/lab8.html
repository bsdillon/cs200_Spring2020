    <h1 class="lab">Lab 8 - GoldField: Reacting to Movers</h1>
    <p>
      This lab will build upon previous work to complete interactions between
      movers. You should feel free to reuse any of your own code or anyone
      elses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a GoldField and put a Mover on it. Add a bunch of other Movers
      to interact with. This could be gold, monsters, or anything else. Add
      moving controls for your main mover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to move into one of the other movers. You will notice that, while
      that move is not allowed, you aren't really interacting with the Mover.
      GoldField is just preventing you from doing something it considers to
      be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the LookAt function to "look before you leap". Look into a space,
      see if it is empty. If there is another Mover, call it's Destroy function
      before moving into that spot. This is a pretty simple interaction, but
      it counts. You might also consider that a Monster can kill you. Try out
      whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add a counter of some sort to the page and keep track of something. It 
      could be number of gold, nubmer of deaths, number of steps, etc. This
      is your output from the code so you can see what is happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put all of this into one web page and submit it through canvas.
