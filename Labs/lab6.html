    <h1 class="lab">Lab 6 - GoldField: Mover inheritance tree</h1>
    <p>
      The GoldField API defines a variety of things that can be drawn on
      the screen. These are called <a href="../GoldField/index.html#Movers">Movers</a>
      because they can be moved. The API defines a variety of methods to get
      the position, set the position, and destroy the Mover. You can work
      with any of these members that are inherited by all Movers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use any of the <a href="../GoldField/index.html#MoverTypes">defined Movers</a>
      to do the following.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Use one of the <a href="../GoldField/index.html#MemberFunctions">member
        functions</a> to create a move on the GoldField.</li>
        <li>Save the Mover you created to a variable. Use the variable to 
        do other things to that Mover.</li>
        <li>Write the ID of the Mover on the screen in some way.</li>
        <li>Write the position of the Mover on the screen.</li>
        <li>LookAt that location to verify that the Mover is there. Write 
        what the LookAt function returns to the screen.</li>
        <li>Use SetPosition to alter the position of the Mover. Write out the new
        position again.</li>
        <li>Use the Destroy method. Hopefully one that makes some noise.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can do this again with as many Movers as you like. Put a final version
      into one page and submit it through canvas.
