    <h1 class="lab">Lab 7 - GoldField: Mover Control</h1>
    <p>
      This lab will establish events for both keyboard and mouse for 
      GoldField and tie them to Movers. Use the <a href="../GoldField/index.html#Events">event functions</a>
      to affect the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by creating a GoldField and putting two movers on the screen.
      You will need to save them to variables so you can get them again.
      Create a click and key function. Use SetClickListener and SetKeyListener
      to connect the events to those functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the click and key listener functions, write to the screen whatever
      information you have in the event. This will help you to understand
      what is happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create at least two "hot key" functions. This means if you press "P" 
      something happens. Hot keys are used to create shortcuts for simple
      functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set up the key listener to move one of the Movers. Use the mouse
      function to move the other. See what happens when you move one of
      them off screen. Is there a way to solve that problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      Put all of this on one web page and submit via canvas.
