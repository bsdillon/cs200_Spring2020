<h1>Blisters - Topic Overview</h1>

<img src="blister.png" width="25%" align="right"> <a href="">Blisters</a> are fluid-filled bumps that look like bubbles on the skin. You may develop a <a href="">blister on your foot</a> when you wear new shoes that rub against your skin or on your hand when you work in the garden without wearing gloves. Home treatment is often all that is needed for this type of blister.

<p class="spaced">
Unfortunately blisters which develop in <a href="">other areas of the body</a> can be much more serious. Blisters on the hands, eyes and ears can cause <a href="">permanent damage</a>. These can be treated and eventually corrected, but that is not the worst case for blisters. A blister on the nose almost always lead to death. The worst cases are accompanied by a strong sunburn over much of the body. Fortunately there is <a href="fool.html">one method of treatment</a> which can prevent death in this extreme circumstance.
