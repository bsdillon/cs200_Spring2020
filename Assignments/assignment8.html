    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>Implement game logic that allows Movers to interact.</dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Create GoldField and add a hero with a mix of several gold and monsters.</li>
          <li>Implement keyboard movement so you can control the hero.</li>
          <li>Put &lt;p&gt; tags for coins and lives on the page.</li>
          <li>Create a function that will take care of destroying the hero, count the lives lost, write them to the page, and create a new Hero randomly.</li>
          <li>Create a function that will take care of destroying the coin, count the coins found, and write them to the page</li>
          <li>When the hero moves, look at the new space first.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>If the space is empty, move the hero into the space.</li>
              <li>If the space has a monster, destroy the monster and call the function to destroy the hero.</li>
              <li>If the space has a coin, call the function to destroy the coin, then move the hero into the space.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. You should have a little mini-game where the hero collects coins and dies if he hits a monster.</li>
          <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
