        Work with another student on this project. Exchange social media accounts, share phones, etc. as necessary to answer the following questions about the other person's online activity and personal security practices. Take away one point for answering yes to a <span class="red">red</span> question. Add one point for answering yes to a <span class="blue">blue</span> question.<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Do you have a phone? If so:<br>
            <ul>
              <li class="blue">Do you have a password to protect it?</li>
              <li class="blue">Is it a good password (i.e. longer than 4 digits, not your birthday, not 'password', etc.)?</li>
              <li class="red">Can you open your phone with your fingerprint or face?</li>
              <li class="red">Open settings and look for Apps > Permissions (Android), Privacy (iPhone), or whatever weird thing you have. Check whether each app needs the permissions it needs (e.g. Food Lion does not need access to my camera). Lose a point for each app that doesn't need a permission.</li>
              <li class="red">Open settings and look for General > Storage (iPhone). If you are a weirdo or on Android try typing *#*#4636#*#* into your phone. This will open the testing activity. Select Usage statistics > Useage time > Last time used. Lose a point for each app that hasn't been used in more than 90 days.</li>
              <li class="red">Is your Location Reporting turned on?</li>
              <li class="red">Is your location embedded in your photos?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For each social media account (twitter, FaceBook, etc) lose a point if you have given them:<br>
            <ul>
              <li class="red">Real address.</li>

              <li class="red">Real phone number</li>
              <li class="red">Picture of your home</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="blue">For each social media account, do you have a good password?</li>
          <li>For each of these lose a point if you have ever done the following with someone you have never met in real life:<br>
            <ul>
              <li class="red">Given your email/phone</li>

              <li class="red">Told them you were going out of town.</li>
              <li class="red">Talked about the work you/your parents do.</li>
              <li class="red">Talked about sex/bodies AT ALL.</li>

              <li class="blue">Do you have a firewall?</li>
              <li class="blue">Is the firewall turned on?</li>
              <li class="blue">Do you have virus protection?</li>
              <li class="blue">Is virus protection turned on?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For each of these lose a point if you have ever done the following with your computer/phone:<br>
            <ul>

          </li>
          <li>BONUS ROUND: Give your phone to a parent (I don't care if you are an adult or not). <span class="red">Lose a point for every photo on your phone that they think is inappropriate</span>, no matter if you took it or if someone gave it to you.</li>
