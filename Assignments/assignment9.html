    <h1 class="assignment">Assignment #9 - GoldField: Mover chase scenes</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>Simulate intelligent "following" behavior in the GoldField API</dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Create GoldField and add a Hero and a Monster.</li>
          <li>Add controls so you can move the Hero.</li>
          <li>Add a heartbeat to the program. When the clock ticks every second, the Monster will move.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Calculate the distance x and y between the monster and the Hero. These values have direction so -x is to the left and +x is to the right.</li>
              <li>Decide which direction you need to move to get closer to the Hero. How you do this will affect the behavior of the Monster.</li>
              <li>Move the Monster one step in the rigth direction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Add a block of gold. When the clock ticks, it should also move AWAY from the human. Use a similar method to that used with the monster. Remember to check for collisions as the gold WILL run into walls.</li>
          <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. You should have a minigame where the user can chase the gold while the monster chases the human.</li>
          <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
