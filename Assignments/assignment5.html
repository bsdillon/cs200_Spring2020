    <h1 class="assignment">Assignment #5 - Heartbeat and motion</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>Use time and GUI functions to create movement metered by a heartbeat function.</dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a clock function that updates every 250 milliseconds.</li>
          <li>Define an object that will bounce around the screen. It doesn't have to be a ball.</li>
          <li>Create an array of objects.</li>
          <li>When the clock "ticks" make each object in the array move.</li>
          <li>Create a button and function that creates one new instance of the object and adds it to the array. You may consider buttons that also add 10 or even 100.</li>
          <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. I suggest testing with ONE object before trying many more.</li>
          <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
