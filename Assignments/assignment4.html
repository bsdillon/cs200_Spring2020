      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>Use GUI elements and background logic to determine a complex "win" condition. </dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a table to create a tic-tac-toe board. Put buttons in each &lt;td&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>When a button is pushed, call a function to remove the button from the tag and put an X.</li>
          <li>After placing an X, use whatever algorithm you want to place the O.</li>
          <li>After each X or O is placed you should check for a win. Remember there are sixteen different win conditions.<br>

          </li>
          <li>Announce the winner if any exists.</li>
          <li>Add a reset button to restore the board to the starting position.</li>
          <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. Consider the following:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Can the user click a button after the game ends? How can you prevent this from happening?</li>
              <li>Can a button be pushed twice quickly? How can you prevent it?</li>
              <li>What happens if no one wins?</li>
              <li>Does the reset work before a game ends?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
