    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>Explore the methods of algorithm development by enumerating the steps of common actions as to a computer.</dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd>
        Consider the steps you take to get up in the morning before leaving for a class/job.<br>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the major steps you have to accomplish (e.g. get dressed)?</li>
          <li>Break down the major steps into small, incremental, repetative actions (e.g. put on shirt, put on socks, put on pants).</li>
          <li>What additional information is necessary to take these steps (e.g. put socks on WHAT)? Be specific as a computer will take very literal actions.<br>

          </li>
          <li>Create a list of the basic action words that a computer would have to understand (e.g. "Put", "Pull", "Go").</li>
          <li>Create a list of objects literals the computer would have to understand (e.g. "Sock", "Shirt").</li>
          <li>Consider how your action words might need parameters and how they will be used (e.g. "Go right", "Go forward").</li>
          <li>One a web page write the list of action words and literals. Write the instructions to get up in the morning using ONLY the action words and literals listed.</li>
          <li>Check your instructions to make sure a computer could execute them if it understood the actions and literals you gave.</li>
          <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work and resolve any bugs.</li>
          <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Repeat all the same steps for a second web page. In this case consider the steps needed to find a word in the dictionary. Note that you will be submitting links to TWO web pages.<br>
