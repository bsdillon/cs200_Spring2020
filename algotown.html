      Welcome to Algo Town where all the women are beautiful and the children are above average... er, 
      at least at computer science. With those broad parallel streets and perpendicular avenues, this
      town is the straight out of American Gothic. And it is the perfect place to raise a family and
      do a few errands on your day off. That is why we are here today. I have a few tasks for you to
      do. Up for the challenge?
    </p>
    <p>
      Please do the following by the end of the day. You can pick your own order as you please.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Leave your red house on the corner of A and 5th.</li>
        <li>Visit each of the four stores along 2nd Street for shopping.</li>
        <li>Visit your sister at the police station.</li>
        <li>Eat lunch at either restaurant along A Avenue.</li>
        <li>Pick up your children on School Circle.</li>
        <li>Pay a parking ticket at the courthouse on Main Street.</li>
        <li>Visit your mother in the orange house on D Avenue.</li>
        <li>Visit your friends houses along 4th Street.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>First Path - Everyone should do this</h1>
    <p>
      Write down a set of statements that describe your path to make your errands today. Follow
      this format so that we can share them with each other.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Left home at A5. A4. Stopped at yellow house</li>
        <li>A4. A3. A2. Red shop. Blue shop. B2. Purple shop. Orange Shop. C2.</li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Pick one of the following to try. Compare with others doing the same task.</h1>
    <h3>Option 1</h3>
    <p>
      Because of the very low speed limit, each segment of road you traverse will take 5 minutes.
      Each of your stops will take at least 15 minutes. Work out a way to do all of these things
      as quickly as possible. Bonus points to the person who can find the shortest trip.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 2</h3>
    <p>
      You know that in your family car each segment of road will cost you 1/10th of a gallon of 
      gas. Each stop will cost you 2/10ths of a gallon. See if your path would change if you try
      to avoid expending too much gas. Bonus points to the person who wastes the least gas.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 3</h3>
    <p>
      Didn't I mention that there are some things you have to do at fixed times? My mistake. Of
      course none of the shops on 2nd Street are open outside of business hours (8am-6pm). Pick up
      at the school promptly at 3:30pm. You won't get lunch prices unless you order between 11:30am
      and 1pm. Your mother goes to bed early at 7pm. It doesn't matter when you leave, but you have
      to be home by bed time at 9pm.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 4</h3>
    <p>
      You are a little obsessive about backtracking. See if you can eliminate any times when you 
      travel along the same road more than once. It may not be possible to leave home, make your
      errands, and then come back home without driving down the same segment of road. Still, you
      can keep it to a minimum.
