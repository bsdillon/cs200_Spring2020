        Some research shows that JavaScript is a difficult language for novice programmers to learn. This class was taught with JavaScript because the applications built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript are transferable anywhere. You can create a website or blog to showcase your work. You can also write tools to use on your computer as a web page. That web page can be shared with your instructor and with others. Your project game, for example, can be sent to your brother, mother, grandpa, and friends. Answer the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>
