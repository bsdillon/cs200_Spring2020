        Some research shows that JavaScript is a difficult language for novice programmers to learn. This class was taught with JavaScript because the applications built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript are transferable anywhere. You can create a website or blog to showcase your work. You can also write tools to use on your computer as a web page. That web page can be shared with your instructor and with others. Your project game, for example, can be sent to your brother, mother, grandpa, and friends. Answer the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Compared with the syntax of C, C++, Python, Java, Cow, etc. how do you feel about the syntax for JavaScript? Would you recommend a different language for future classes?

I sometimes hear non-programmers refer to this kind of work as boring. Among developers, when you finally get it to work or when the program works as you expected the first time, the rush is so good that they tend to literally dance in the halls. Alternatively, programming has been described as spending your whole life searching for a missing ‘}’. Did you experience one or both? Describe your experience.

Based on the “Every Major’s Terrible” song and your experience in this class, how have your career plans altered? Are you excited about your intended major?
