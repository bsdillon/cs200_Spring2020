    <h1 class="homework">Homework 8 - GoldField: Look-plan algorithms</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first homework that will use the <a href="../GoldField/index.html">goldfield API</a>. If you have any questions, you can read more about the API at that link. This homework will create a very stupid AI--something like the ghosts in Pac-Man.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start with your homework 7. You will need the same steps in your response to this homework, so make a new copy.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the field is created, save the Monster and Hero to variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a heartbeat and when the beat occurs, call a move function.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the move function,<br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Figure out the &Delta;x and &Delta;y from the Monster to the Human.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick the best direction to move to get closer. For example, you might always go left/right first and then up/down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Figure out the new x,y location where you want to move.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>LookAt</code> that location. If it is empty, <code>SetPosition</code> for that spot.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        See what happens when the field is empty of obstacles. What if it is very full? Is this a bad thing in a game? Is this a thing a human player would do?
      </li>
      <li>
        There are lots of ways to get around getting trapped. Read about some of the options at one of these places. You are not <em>required</em> to do any of these. If you tried, which one would you use? Write a paragraph for your answer.<br>

        Compare this with the results of an AI. Consider that this topic is important for your phone's GPS and also for self-driving cars. One works well, the other not...yet. What do you think about a computer's ability to make this kind of decision? Write a paragraph for your answer.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aut32pR5PQA">7</a>]</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. You should be able to repeatedly watch the Monster move toward the Hero.
      </li>
      <li>
        Submit the link to the page in Canvas.
