    <ol>
      <li>Create a simple game where the computer asks you to click on the right place.</li>
      <li>Create a canvas tag and select a random x and y coordinate on the screen.</li>
      <li>Ask the user to click on that place. Capture the x and y of the mouse event location.</li>
      <li>Score the user based on how close the click was to the intended target. Maybe show where the right location was.</li>
      <li>Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. You should be able to play the game by yourself to test your GUI location skills.</li>
      <li>Submit the link to the page in Canvas.</li>
