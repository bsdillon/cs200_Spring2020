    <h1 class="homework">Homework 7 - GoldField: Search for Mover</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first homework that will use the <a href="../GoldField/index.html">goldfield API</a>. If you have any questions, you can read more about the API at that link.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a web page and put a tag on the page for GoldField to use. Create the GoldField in code and fill it with a random number of obstacles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the hero and one monster on the field. These should be placed at random.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a pair of for loops to <code>LookAt</code> each block in the field. When you find the hero record the position. When you find the monster, record the position.
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as you have found both of them figure out the &Delta;x and &Delta;y between them. Create an output tag and write out something like this:<br>
        <code><pre>The Monster is 4 right and 3 up from the Hero.</pre></code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a reset button that clears the field and does it all again.
      </li>
      <li>
Put all these elements in a page. Test to make sure the buttons work as expected and resolve any bugs. You should be able to check your code again and again to see if it gives you the right answer.</li>
      <li>
        Submit the link to the page in Canvas.
      </li>
    </ol>
