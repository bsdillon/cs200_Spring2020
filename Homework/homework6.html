    <h1 class="homework">Homework 6 - GoldField: Looking at locations</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first homework that will use the goldfield API. It was created expressly for the purpose of teaching programming by simplifying certain actions and allowing a student to get more done while working only with the most basic parts of the code. In this homework assignment you will work with the LookAt function.
