      This kind of problem is a common task that many people have to do on the average weekend. It is
      common enough to have many places to visit on a vacation and a limited number of dollars and days
      to spend in these pursuits. The problem is so common that it even has a number of formal names,
      depending on what you value most in your answer. In general it is an optimization path problem
      because you are asked to create a path and that path must be set to maximize or minimize some
      value, whether it is gas usage or time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In defining a path, the places you need to visit are important features. The exact tasks are 
      not important, but this is the list in case you want an easy reference. There are other places
      that aren't named, but exist on your path and are implied in your trip. For example, there is 
      nothing on the corner of 3rd and C, but if you cross that intersection, it is a step in your
      path. The image below shows first a silly path that no one would choose, but it is acceptable.
      It also shows the places at each intersection as additional destinations. In path optimization
      problems it is useful to consider a <em>graph</em>. A graph consists of nodes like these gray
      circles and edges like the black road between them.<br>

    <h1>First Path - Everyone should do this</h1>
    <p>
      In the first path problem, you are allowed to pick any path you want without any expectations.
      This is known as an <em>unconstrained</em> solution. Nothing is forbidden. Even a ridiculous
      path like the one above is acceptable as long as it visits each place. Just based on your own
      experience at this task, you likely gave yourself more constraints than were actually given.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 1</h3>
    <p>
      This is an optimization based on a form of <em>cost</em>. Costs can vary quite a lot, but time
      is faily common. Do it faster. Do it before some limit. Do it with as little time as possible.
      Part of the "science" of computer science is working on the theory of the problem. What is the
      theoretical minimum that a path could take?
    </p>
    <h3>Option 2</h3>
    <p>
      This optimization by gas mileage is another form of cost optimization. In this case there is
      a resource that must be conserved. It could be gas in a car or battery power in your phone.
      At one time the amount of memory in a computer was very limited. Today that is so cheap a
      resource that no one really cares much. But with today's hand-held devices, batter power matters
      more than ever. If an algorithm wasted all your battery power, you might not like that very
      much.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 3</h3>
    <p>
      This is a set of constraints that will affect how your algorithm develops. If you think of your
      path like a rubber band, these constraints put a pin firmly in the path at fixed points in time
      and space. You might stretch the band between those pins, but there will be limits to what you
      can do. There are only 60 minutes in an hour, after all is said and done. Some paths become
      <em>infeasible</em>, meaning that they aren't possible because of the constraints. If you have
      extra time and options between those pins, it is <em>slack</em> in the path.
    </p>
    <h3>Option 4</h3>
    <p>
      This kind of optimization is also common. <em>Efficiency</em is always the best and biggest goal. 
      Which would you prefer, a path that will get you from Richmond to DC in the straightest possible 
      path, or one that goes by way of Roanoke? An algorithm may be optimized to be efficient sometimes
      values some resource, but often it simply avoids reworking anything it doesn't have to. In this
      case you are being asked to solve the famouse <em>Traveling Salesman Problem</em>. This problem
      is impossible to solve in the most efficient way possible. Anyone can do it with 3 stops, or 5.
      You don't have to get much past 5 stops before the path becomes unsolvable. You could work on one
      problem your whole life. No one wants to waste that much time so many solutions are <em>approximations</em>
      of the best problem with some unknown error. Such algorithms are called <em>heuristics</em>.
